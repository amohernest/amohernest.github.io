I'm Ernest, a Master's candidate in **Air Quality Control, Solid Waste and Waste Water Process Engineering** at Universität Stuttgart, specializing in **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**. My research focuses on optimizing air/water pollution control systems, waste valorization processes, and urban drainage infrastructure using CFD modeling and sustainable process engineering.

**Core CFD Applications:**  
- Turbulent dispersion modeling for air pollutant mitigation  
- Multiphase reactor simulations in water/wastewater treatment  
- Thermal process optimization for waste-to-energy conversion  

**Toolbox:**  
OpenFOAM  • ParaView • Python • MATLAB
